# Vatsal Khanna
    
**Researcher | Builder | Learner**
    
I am an engineering undergraduate at the **Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar (NITJ)**, focused on the convergence of Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, and Applied Mathematics. My work is driven by a desire to understand and build pseudo intelligent artificial structures.

## **Research & Technical Focus**
    
My primary research interests lie in the deep working, interpretability, and application of artificial intelligence.
    
- **Generative AI & Safety:** Investigating the proliferation of deepfakes and developing detection methodologies to counter synthetic media manipulation.
- **Foundational Machine Learning:** Exploring the origins of intelligence, focusing on interpretability and the mathematical modeling of machine behavior.
- **Pseudo-Intelligent Structures:** Designing systems that mimic intelligent decision-making in constrained environments, applicable in both software and hardware systems.

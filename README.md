**Researcher | Builder | Learner**
    
I am an engineering undergraduate at the **Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar (NITJ)**, focused on the convergence of Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, and Applied Mathematics. My work is driven by a desire to understand and build pseudo intelligent artificial structures.
